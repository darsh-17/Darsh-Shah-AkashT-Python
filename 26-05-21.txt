Today was Day-2 of our Python and Django Internship. First we were introduced to comments in Python. How can we
make single line and double line comments, what are the various uses of comments etc.. Then we were taught
how can we declare and assign values to variables. How can we assign same value to different variables and
and how can we assign different values to different variables using a single line of code. Then we were
introduced to different data types of Python such as String, Tuple, List, Dictionary and various operations
that can be applied to them such as slicing and dicing.
